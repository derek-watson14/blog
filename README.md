  Personal Blog
</h3>

I'm setting up this blog so I have a place to write about things I learn and do while studying computer science at the University of Colorado, Boulder starting in January of 2022. Then in the future I can quickly revisit concepts, find code examples and generally remember things more quickly.

I'm also hopeful that writing during my classes will help reinforce concepts that I learn.
